# I'm Kevin Jimenez

## A Systems Engineer from Per√∫

I work as a **Coordinator** in a Digital Factory on my country. I like to program in my free times, my favorite techonologies are Containers, Javascript, Java, MongoDB and MariaDB, but I would like to learn about Go, Python, Kubernets, Devops, DevSecops and IA.

I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Direction of Technologies Information in ESAN University, it's difficult but fun and very interesting.
