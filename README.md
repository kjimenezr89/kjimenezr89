# I'm Kevin Jimenez

## Systems Engineer from Per√∫
I work as a **Coordinator** in a Digital Factory on my country. I like to program in my free times, my favorite techonologies are Containers, Javascript, Java, MongoDB and MariaDB, but I would like to learn about Go, Python, Kubernets, Devops, DevSecops and IA.

I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Direction of Information Techonologies in ESAN University, it's difficult but fun and very interesting.

## The 5 commands that I use the most
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ls | List current directory |
| cd | Change directory |
| clear | Clean terminal |
| mkdir | Create a directory |
| sudo | Run the command as admin. |
